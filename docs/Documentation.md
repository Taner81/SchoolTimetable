**Documentation**
All schools have a different timetable system. For instance ours is a 2 week rotating 6 period day timetable.

When we run the reports in SIMS we use the following period UNC:
1Fri:6
This is:
_WeekNo_**Day**:+Period+

The following manual will work for you with everything out of the box if you have exactly the same timetable system. We understand this is unlikely so, we have written this as best as possible to 1. explain the mechanics of what we have built and 2. help you change the workings to suit your needs.
